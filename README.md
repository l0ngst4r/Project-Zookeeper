# Project-Zookeeper
first project of Python Basics by JetBrains Academy
Stage 1:
Description
One of the most important parts of working with animals is keeping an eye on them. We need to see the animals on the screen to know how they are doing, right? Now we are ready to print something awesome: an image of an animal!

Objectives
For the second stage, you will need to develop an animal printer. Your program should display the animal identified in the code field.

Please, don't remove the r character at the start of the code template. It's a part of the string and it's important. So, the string should start with r""" sequence. This “r” at the beginning stands for “raw” and allows various characters to be used in a string without escaping. For instance, “\” in a non-raw string should be escaped as follows: “\\”.


Stage 2 (current):
Description
Now it's time to make our project user-friendly. In this final stage, you'll make your software ready for the zoo staff to use. Your program should understand the habitat numbers, show the animals, and be able to work continuously without having to be restarted.

Objectives
Your tasks at this point:

Your program should repeat the behavior from the previous stage, but now in a loop.

Do not forget to include an exit opportunity: inputting exit should end the program.

When the program is done running, it should print: See you later!
